Today's module is yet another one of those clever little ditties from the
Mad Aussie. The source consists of a measly four statements, though the
implementation itself is but a single line of code. Originally named
<tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Acme::Don't">Don't</a></tt>,
it now lives in the zany outland of toys and baubles dubbed <tt>Acme</tt>.
<tt>Don't</tt> does nothing. More specifically it does nothing to blocks of
code. It's not a broken code filter, it simply prevents code from being
executed. What good is that? Well, perhaps your text editor doesn't support
block commenting (or it works poorly). With <tt>don't</tt> you can now easily
comment out large portions of your code for testing. Sure you could use an
<tt>if</tt> with a false condition but use of the special "keyword"
<tt>don't</tt> will make your code clearer as it avoids abusing existing
syntax. Of course one could argue <tt>don't</tt> does so as well, since it
uses the deprecated Perl 4 package seperator <tt>'</tt>. So enjoy the simple
beauty of today's module sometime, or <tt>don't</tt>.
