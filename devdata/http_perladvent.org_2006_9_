Somebody snitched on me &#x266a; Are you a closet
<a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/S/shotgun-debugging.html">shotgun
debugger</a>? Or maybe you use a liberal sprinkling of <tt>print</tt>s or
<tt><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/Carp.html">cluck</a></tt>s? Of course
the recommended practice though, is to use the perl debugger; invoked by the
switch <tt>-d</tt>. The standard
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perldebug.html">perl debugger</a>, while
powerful, can be pretty intimidating or just plain painful. Enter
<tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Devel::ptkdb">ptkdb</a></tt>,
a simple GUI debugger in Perl/Tk. It provides the usual feature set:
breakpoints, stepping, and watching (full expressions, not simply variables).
<tt>ptkdb</tt> is pretty nifty and can be a godsend, if you remember to use it
;-)</p>

<p>No code sample today, the screen shot below was taken of
<a href="../../2005/8/">one  from last year</a>; less <tt>Interpolation</tt>.

<h2>RESOURCES</h2>
A slightly older version of <tt>ptkdb</tt> is available as a part of a tarball
with a functional Perl/Tk for Win32 on <a href="http://ptkdb.sf.net">SourceForge</a>

As you may have noticed, the past few days' write-ups haven't been especially
complicated. I've got quite a lot on my plate right now and had been hoping,
as editor, to only need to write a handful of reviews this year. Please
consider contributing some <a href="../../contact.html">suggestions</a> or
<a href="../../FAQ-submit.html">entries</a>.</blockquote>
