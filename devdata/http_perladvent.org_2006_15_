<p>So, you need to access files in a user's home directory to parse a resource
file, replace his inbox with a can of SPAM, etc. etc. Sure you could try
using <tt>$HOME</tt> (if it's set, good luck on Win32) or <tt>getpwent</tt>
(Win32 loses again) or even

<pre>
<span class="k">glob</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">'~'</span><span class="s">)</span>
</pre>

This last one shows promise, until you try to get the home of another user e.g;
<tt>~administrator</tt> (on everyone's favorite platform). If all of this is
reminiscent of coping with the joining, splitting and other -ings of paths
pre-<tt>File::Spec</tt> then you might wonder why there's nothing along the
lines of a <tt>File::Spec::Home</tt> to do all of the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Presenting the all new, redesigned 2006 model
<tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=File::HomeDir">File::HomeDir</a></tt>.
This module provides a platform-agnostic framework for determining the location
of a user's home directory, and other possible special folders such as
<tt>/(?:My&nbsp;)?(?:Documents/Music|Videos)/</tt>. <tt>File::HomeDir</tt>
still needs additional code though, to detect and report the location of these
and the user's desktop on the Unices, where they vary between KDE, Gnome, and
other environments. Also note that until 0.60 goes gold, you need to install
the developer's release (currently 0.60_6) in order for the <tt>users_*</tt>
methods like below to work properly; they were left out of the base class in
0.58 but the platform specific implementations can be called directly.
